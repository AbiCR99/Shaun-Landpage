      'Shaun Nolanh is a progressive house producer and DJ based in La Falda, Córdoba, Argentina. Originally from the iconic tourist city of Villa Carlos Paz, he immersed himself in the electronic music scene from a young age, attending shows by artists like Nick Warren and Guy J, and trying to recreate at home what moved him so deeply.',
      'This passion led him to study sound at the La Metro School of Design and Audiovisual Communication, where he graduated as a Higher Technician in Sound in 2021. Since his 2025 debut on 3rd Avenue with Three of a Kind #033, he has collaborated with labels such as BBop Music, Mustache Crew Records, and DUBLUCID —releasing his latest EP, Hibiki, through the latter— as well as crafting an official remix of “Paul’s Tape” by Valentín Ciancio.',
      'Alongside Stan Seba, he produced the EPs Chrome Butterflies and Case 701, earning support from Gai Barone, who featured their singles on his Patterns podcast. He is currently collaborating with Praneeth.D and working on upcoming official remixes for 3rd Avenue and Future Avenue.',
